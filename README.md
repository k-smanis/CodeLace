# CodeLace
CodeLace is an autonomous, agentic software engineer that turns natural language intent into tested, version-controlled FastAPI servers. It follows a TDD-first, iterative workflow â€” clarifying requirements, generating API specs, writing tests, implementing endpoints, running tests, and committing progress step by step like a real developer.
